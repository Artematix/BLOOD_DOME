# Progression Rules

## Summary

How characters level up and improve in Blood Dome.

## Starting Level

All characters start at **Level 5**.

## Leveling Up

*To be defined.*

Consider:
- What triggers level up (XP, coins, rounds survived)
- Level cap
- What each level grants (defined per character)

## Notes

Each character has a `progression` block defining what they gain at each level.
