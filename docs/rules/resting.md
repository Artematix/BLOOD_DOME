# Resting Rules

## Summary

There are **NO short or long rests** in the Blood Dome. Instead, players can take a special "rest action" on their turn, and must recover spell slots and long rest features through skill checks.

---

## Rest Action

On your turn, you may forgo **all actions and movements** and simply pass your turn. Doing so grants you a **rest**.

### Benefits of a Rest
- Gain all the benefits of a short rest
- You may spend as many **hit dice** as you wish

### Rest Interruption
Taking damage or being affected in any other way **cancels your rest attempt**.

---

## Recovering Spell Slots

Spell slots cannot be recovered through resting. Instead:

**As an action**, you can attempt to regain a spell slot:
- Make a roll using your **spellcasting ability**
- **DC = 5 x the spell's level**
- On a **success**, you regain that spell slot

| Spell Level | DC |
|-------------|-----|
| 1st | 5 |
| 2nd | 10 |
| 3rd | 15 |
| 4th | 20 |
| 5th | 25 |

## Recovering Long Rest Features

For features that normally require a long rest to recharge:

**As an action**, you can attempt to recover the feature:
- Make a **DC 10 check** using your class's **primary ability**
- On a **success**, you regain the listed feature

### Primary Abilities by Class
| Class | Primary Ability |
|-------|-----------------|
| Barbarian | Strength |
| Bard | Charisma |
| Cleric | Wisdom |
| Druid | Wisdom |
| Fighter | Strength or Dexterity |
| Monk | Dexterity or Wisdom |
| Paladin | Charisma |
| Ranger | Dexterity or Wisdom |
| Rogue | Dexterity |
| Sorcerer | Charisma |
| Warlock | Charisma |
| Wizard | Intelligence |

## Character Rest Abilities

Upon reaching **Level 6** (via character level-up quest), each character gains a unique **rest ability**. This ability can be used in addition to the standard rest benefits.

See individual character files for their specific rest abilities.

---

## Notes

- The rest action is high-risk: you're vulnerable for a full round
- Consider positioning carefully before attempting a rest
- Enemies and other players may interrupt your rest
- Rest abilities at Level 6 provide additional tactical options
