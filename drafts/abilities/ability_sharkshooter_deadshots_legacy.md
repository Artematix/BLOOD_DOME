# Deadshot's Legacy

*Father could shoot a seagull's eye from 300 paces. I can shoot through your skull from 400.*

## Effect

Your mastery of ranged weapons is supernatural. Captain Marcus Thorne's legendary marksmanship flows through your veins, enhanced by divine predatory focus. You gain the following benefits:

- You ignore half cover and three-quarters cover when making ranged weapon attacks
- You ignore total cover if you can trace any path to the target (shoot around corners, through gaps)
- Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls
- When you make a ranged weapon attack on your turn, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +12 to the attack's damage
- **Execution Shot:** Once per turn, when you hit a creature that is below 25% of its maximum hit points with a ranged weapon attack, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier). On a failed save, the creature is reduced to 0 hit points as you strike a vital organ. On a success, it takes an additional 2d10 damage.

You don't miss. And when you aim to kill, targets simply die.

## Interaction Notes

This ability transforms SharkShooter into a terrifying executioner at range. The Execution Shot feature allows for instant kills against heavily wounded enemies, making him exceptionally deadly in the Blood Dome where wounded combatants are everywhere. The enhanced cover penetration means nowhere is safe from his aim.
