# Scent of Blood

*Blood in the water. Your mother's hunger stirs. The hunt begins.*

## Effect

You gain supernatural ability to track wounded prey and exploit their weakness. You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track any creature that is below its maximum hit points. Additionally, you can smell blood on the air - you automatically know the direction and exact distance to any creature within 60 feet that is bloodied (at half HP or less).

**Bloodlust Trigger:** When you hit a bloodied creature with an attack, you deal an additional 1d6 damage as your predatory instincts surge. This damage increases to 1d8 if the creature is below 25% of its maximum hit points.

This sense works even if you cannot see the creature and pierces through fog, darkness, and light cover. The scent of fear and dying flesh drives you into a cold, calculated frenzy.

## Interaction Notes

This ability synergizes with SharkShooter's ranged combat style - wound enemies from afar, track them relentlessly, then punish their weakness with brutal efficiency. The bonus damage against bloodied foes encourages aggressive finishing. In the Blood Dome, wounded prey doesn't escape - it bleeds out.
