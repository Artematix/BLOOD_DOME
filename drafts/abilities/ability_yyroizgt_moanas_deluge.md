# Moan-a's Deluge

*"WITNESS THE GODDESS OF THE DEEP! THE BLOOD TIDE RISES! DROWN IN HER CRIMSON WATERS!"*

## Effect

**Action** - 1 use per long rest

Yyroizgt raises his arms and screams to the heavens. The air ripples. Then the ocean herself answers - a catastrophic tsunami erupts from nowhere, a 30-foot wall of seawater mixed with blood crashes down on everyone around him. Bodies are thrown, bones break, and when the water recedes, the arena floor is awash in saltwater and gore.

**All creatures within 30 feet** (Yyroizgt chooses targets - usually enemies) must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 16):

**On a Failed Save:**
- Takes 6d8 bludgeoning damage as the tsunami slams them like a battering ram
- **Knocked prone** - swept off their feet and slammed into the ground
- **Pushed 10 feet away** - hurled back by the force
- **Soaked in blood and brine** (wet status, 1 minute)
- Left coughing, bleeding, and gasping in the shallow water

**On a Successful Save:**
- Takes half damage (still brutal - crushed by water pressure)
- Manage to stay standing
- Still **soaked in seawater and blood** (wet status, 1 minute)
- The ocean has marked them for death

**The Flooded Arena:**
- The 60-foot area becomes difficult terrain (ankle-deep bloody seawater) for 1 minute
- All creatures in the water are considered "in water"
- **Yyroizgt gains advantage on ALL attacks** while standing in this sacred flood (Ocean's Domain)
- The arena floor becomes slick with blood, brine, and broken bodies

**Flavor:** This is Moan-a's judgment made manifest - a tidal wave of death that leaves nothing but wreckage, wet victims ready for sacrifice, and Yyroizgt standing in the center of a blood-red sea.

## Interaction Notes

**This is Yyroizgt's Ultimate - The Blood Tide:**

**Why This Wins Fights:**
1. **Mass Devastation**: 4d8 damage to EVERYONE in 30 feet - that's potentially 18 damage to 6+ enemies
2. **Total Wet Coverage**: Every single target gets soaked - all marked for death, all count for the quest
3. **Battlefield Domination**: Creates a 30-foot pool of blood-water where Yyroizgt has advantage
4. **Crowd Control**: Knocks multiple enemies prone and scatters them
5. **Setup for Massacre**: Multiple wet, injured, prone enemies = easy multi-kills
6. **Works Both Paths**: Aggressive uses it for damage, Tactical uses it for mass control

**Blood Dome Applications:**

**The Mass Execution:**
- Surrounded by multiple enemies? Deluge hits them ALL
- They're all wet, many are prone, all are injured
- Pick them off one by one while they're vulnerable
- Each wet kill counts for Blood Tide quest

**The Opening Salvo:**
- Start a big fight with Deluge
- Instantly establish dominance - everyone's hurt, wet, and scattered
- Stand in your blood-water pool with advantage on all attacks
- Hunt down the survivors

**The Finishing Move:**
- Multiple enemies at low HP? Deluge might kill them all
- Survivors are wet and damaged - finish them easily
- Complete your quest in one glorious flood

**The Turnaround:**
- Losing a fight? Desperate? Deluge resets the battlefield
- Massive damage, everyone scattered, you're in your element
- Turn a loss into a victory through the goddess's power

**Why It's Tier 3:**
- Only 1 use per long rest (must be used wisely)
- Significant AoE damage (4d8 to multiple targets)
- Guarantees wet status on ALL targets (even on successful save)
- Creates beneficial terrain for 1 minute
- Knocks prone (disadvantage on ranged attacks, advantage for melee)
- DC 15 means good success rate
- Can turn fights around with proper timing
- Ultimate quest completion enabler
- Works as capstone for both Aggressive and Tactical paths

**Counterplay:**
- Only happens once per long rest
- Spread out (don't cluster within 30ft of Yyroizgt)
- Have high Dexterity saves
- Kill or disable Yyroizgt before he can use it
- Bait it out early when targets aren't ideal
- Run away after it's used (wet status still expires)

**Path Synergies:**
- **Aggressive Path**: Deluge → Focus fire wet targets with Tidal Strike → Execute with Crushing Depths
- **Tactical Path**: Deluge → Undertow stragglers back → Wave Crash to prone → Slaughter
- **Both Paths**: The ultimate quest enabler - soak them all, then pick your victims

## Balance Considerations

**This is Properly Tier 3 Because:**
- **Once Per Long Rest**: This is your ace in the hole - use it wisely
- **20 Gold Investment**: Expensive but worth it for a potential fight-winner
- **High Impact, High Risk**: Only works if enemies cluster near you
- **Counterable**: Spread out, save well, focus fire Yyroizgt before he can use it
- **Not Instant Win**: Damages and sets up, but you still need to execute

**Compared to Tier 2 Abilities:**
- **Scale**: Hits 6+ enemies vs 1 target
- **Total Damage**: 18 damage x 6 targets = 108 total damage potential
- **Setup Potential**: Creates multiple wet targets for quest, not just one
- **Terrain Control**: Lasts 1 minute, benefits every attack

**The Blood Dome Truth:**
This ability is called "Blood Tide" for a reason. When Yyroizgt unleashes Moan-a's Deluge, the arena floods with seawater that quickly turns red. Bodies litter the flooded ground. The survivors are soaked, broken, and marked for death. This is Yyroizgt's moment - when the ocean goddess herself enters the Blood Dome to claim her sacrifices.

**Use it when you're ready to end the fight.**

## Compliance Notes

**Tier 3 - Ultimate**: This ability is now properly assigned to Tier 3 (20g) and serves as the capstone ability for both Aggressive and Tactical paths. Complies with Blood Dome conventions.
