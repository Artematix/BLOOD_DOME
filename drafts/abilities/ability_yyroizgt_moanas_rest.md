# Feeding Frenzy

*"Moan-a hungers. The shark must feed. Drive the trident deep, offer their blood to the deep, and the goddess grants you strength for the next kill."*

## Effect

**Action** - Once between combat encounters

The battle is over. Bodies litter the arena floor. Yyroizgt **offers them to Moan-a**. He drives his sacred trident through each corpse - not to desecrate, but to **sacrifice**. As the prongs pierce dead flesh, the trident drinks. Not blood, but something deeper - the last remnants of life force, the final breath, the soul's echo.

**The trident is the shark.** Its three prongs are teeth. As it feeds on the slain, seawater wells up from the wounds and flows into Yyroizgt, healing him. The more sacrifices he offers, the stronger the blessing. This is Moan-a's covenant: **kill for her, feed her weapon, and she sustains you through the slaughter.**

**Sacrifice Mechanic:**
- **Impale nearby corpses** within 10 feet (player characters, enemies, anyone dead)
- **Heal 1d8 per corpse sacrificed** (maximum 4 corpses = 4d8)
- **Add Charisma modifier** to total healing
- **No corpses nearby?** Still heal 1d8 + CHA (the trident remembers past kills - it always hungers)

**Examples:**
- 1 sacrifice: 1d8 + CHA (~8 HP)
- 2 sacrifices: 2d8 + CHA (~12 HP)
- 3 sacrifices: 3d8 + CHA (~17 HP)
- 4+ sacrifices: 4d8 + CHA (~21 HP max)

**The Ritual:**
You walk among the corpses. For each one, you drive the trident through their heart. Seawater erupts from the wound, pooling around the body - not blood-tainted arena water, but pure ocean brine. The water flows upward, drawn to you, absorbed into your wounds. Each sacrifice feeds the weapon. Each kill sustains the killer.

**Blood Scent (1 minute):**
After the sacrifices are offered, the trident **awakens**. It smells blood in the water. It hungers for the wounded. For 1 minute, you and your weapon hunt as one:
- **The Shark's Sense**: You feel the trident pull toward wounded prey - you sense the direction and distance of any creature within 60 feet below half HP
- **Feeding Frenzy**: Your movement speed increases by 10 feet when moving toward wounded prey (the trident pulls you forward)
- **Predator's Focus**: Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks - the weapon sharpens your senses

**Limitations:**
- Only works between fights (can't use while enemies threaten you)
- Once per combat encounter
- Requires 1 action to perform the sacrificial ritual
- Must physically impale corpses with your trident to gain maximum healing

**Flavor:** Your trident is not just a weapon - it is the physical manifestation of Moan-a's hunger. The three prongs are shark teeth. When you drive it through the dead, you're not desecrating - you're **feeding the goddess through her sacred instrument**. The Blood Dome is her altar. The corpses are offerings. And your weapon drinks deep.

## Interaction Notes

**This is Yyroizgt's Level 6 Rest Ability - Feeding Frenzy:**

**Why This Embodies Moan-a and the Trident-Shark:**

Moan-a is not served through prayer and hymns. She demands **sacrifice**. The trident is her sacred instrument - a weapon that is also a living shark, manifested in bronze and blessed steel. When you impale the dead on its prongs, you're not defiling them - you're **consecrating them to the goddess of the killing seas**.

**Key Features:**

1. **Sacrificial Ritual**: Physically impale corpses with the trident - feed the weapon, feed the goddess
2. **The Trident as Shark**: Your weapon hungers, drinks, and grants strength - it IS the predator
3. **Scales with Offerings**: More sacrifices = more healing - the goddess rewards devotion
4. **Awakened Weapon**: After feeding, the trident gains predator senses and pulls you toward wounded prey
5. **Very Blood Dome**: Turn the arena into a sacrificial altar where every corpse serves the goddess

**Strategic Applications:**

**The Sacrificial Ritual:**
- After a big fight with 3-4 kills → walk among the bodies
- **Impale each corpse** with your trident through the heart
- Seawater erupts, flows into you → 4d8 + CHA healing (~21 HP)
- The weapon drinks deep, you heal, the goddess is pleased

**Hunt Mode - The Awakened Trident:**
- After sacrifices are offered → the trident **awakens**
- Feel it pull toward wounded prey within 60 feet
- Move 10 feet faster as the weapon drags you forward (Feeding Frenzy)
- The shark hunts through you - you are its vessel

**Combo with Abilities:**
- **After Deluge**: Tsunami wounds everyone → sacrifice the dead → trident senses all wounded survivors → hunt them down
- **With Blood Sharks**: Your sharks wound prey → sacrifice the kills → your awakened trident tracks the rest → you and your sharks hunt together
- **After Crushing Depths**: Crush someone to death → impale their corpse → heal + awakened weapon → hunt the next target

**Positioning Tactics:**
- Fight near corpses to maximize sacrifices
- Drag fresh kills together with Undertow if time permits
- In team fights, position near allied kills - those are offerings too
- **Every corpse in the arena is a potential sacrifice**

**Blood Dome Applications:**

**The Sacrificial Cycle:**
1. **Mass Slaughter**: Kill 3+ enemies → impale all corpses with trident → 4d8 + CHA healing → weapon awakens → hunt wounded survivors
2. **Single Kill Blessing**: Kill 1 target → drive trident through their heart → 1d8 + CHA healing → awakened weapon reveals other wounded prey
3. **Sustained Hunt**: Kill → Sacrifice → Heal → Trident Awakens → Hunt → Kill → Repeat
4. **The Shark Feeds**: The trident drinks, the goddess is fed, you heal, and the hunt continues

**The Sacred Covenant:**

**The trident is not just a weapon - it is Moan-a's hunger made manifest:**
- Kill for the goddess → Sacrifice the slain to her → She heals you through the weapon
- The more you kill, the more you sacrifice → The more she blesses you
- The trident drinks souls, not blood → You are sustained by devotion, not magic
- **This is how the shark goddess is served** - through slaughter, sacrifice, and the endless hunt

**The Blood Dome Truth:**

The arena is **Moan-a's temple**. Every fight is a religious rite. Every corpse is an offering. When you drive the trident through the dead, you're not just healing - you're **performing sacred sacrifice**. The weapon drinks, the goddess is fed, and she grants you the strength to kill again.

**The prongs are teeth. The weapon is the shark. You are the priest of slaughter.**

**This is the reward for completing Blood Tide** - proof that Moan-a has blessed you with her sacred weapon, a living shark that feeds on the dead and pulls you toward the next kill.

## Compliance Notes

**Rest Ability**: This is the required Level 6 rest ability, gained from completing the level-up quest. Complies with Blood Dome conventions.

**Not Part of Tier System**: Rest abilities are special rewards and don't count toward the tier structure.
