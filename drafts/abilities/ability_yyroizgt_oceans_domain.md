# Ocean's Domain

*"I don't need to chase you. The ocean follows me wherever I walk. Step into my domain, and you're already drowning."*

## Effect

**Passive Feature**

Yyroizgt carries the ocean with him. Moan-a's divine blessing manifests as an invisible field of saltwater and brine that surrounds him at all times - a 10-foot radius where the goddess's domain bleeds into reality. Anyone who enters this killing zone is immediately drenched in seawater, marked for death by the ocean herself.

**Mechanical Effects:**

1. **Wet Aura (10-foot radius)**
   - A field of water surrounds you at all times in a 10-foot radius
   - Any enemy that enters or starts their turn in this area gains the "wet" status (1 minute duration)
   - The water is invisible but manifests as spray, mist, and dampness when enemies approach
   - This aura moves with you - you are always the center of the ocean's domain

2. **Hunter's Advantage**
   - **You have advantage on all attack rolls against creatures with the 'wet' status**
   - This applies to weapon attacks, unarmed strikes, and spell attacks
   - Works automatically - no action required
   - Permanent passive benefit

**Why This is Devastating:**

You don't need to apply wet status manually - anyone who gets close to you is automatically soaked. Then you get advantage on all attacks against them. In melee combat, this makes you nearly unstoppable:

- Enemy closes to melee range → instantly wet
- You attack with advantage → they're easier to hit
- They stay wet for 1 minute → you keep attacking with advantage
- Even if they run away, they're still wet → advantage continues

## Interaction Notes

**This is Yyroizgt's Core Passive - The Ocean Walks With Him:**

**Why This Makes You Unstoppable:**

1. **Automatic Wet Application**: Anyone in melee range (10 feet) is instantly wet - no action needed, no resource cost
2. **Permanent Advantage**: Once they're wet (which happens automatically), you attack with advantage
3. **Quest Enabler**: Every enemy you fight in melee automatically counts toward your Blood Tide quest
4. **No Escape**: Even if they run away after entering your aura, they're wet for 1 minute
5. **Zone Control**: Enemies must choose - stay 10+ feet away (can't melee you) or enter and get soaked

**Deadly Applications:**

**Melee Dominance:**
- You walk toward enemy → they enter your 10ft aura → instantly wet
- You attack with advantage → increased hit chance and crit chance
- They stay to fight → still wet, you keep advantage
- They run → still wet for 1 minute, you can chase with advantage

**Forced Choices:**
- Melee enemies MUST enter your aura to attack you → they get wet → you get advantage
- Ranged enemies can avoid the aura but you can close distance with Undertow
- Multiple enemies clustered around you? They're ALL wet → advantage on ALL of them

**Synergy With Abilities:**
- **Tidal Strike**: They're already wet from aura → 2d8 cold damage instead of 1d8
- **Crushing Depths**: They're already wet → 4d8 damage instead of 3d8
- **Undertow**: Pull them into your aura → they get wet (if not already) → disadvantage on STR save → easier to pull
- **Blood Sharks**: Your aura keeps enemies wet → sharks get +1d6 damage (Home-Ocean Advantage)
- **Deluge**: Your 10ft aura + Deluge's 30ft flood = massive wet coverage

**The Blood Dome Reality:**

Yyroizgt doesn't just fight in water - **he IS the water**. The ocean goddess has marked him so thoroughly that her domain manifests wherever he stands. In the Blood Dome arena, this means:

- Every melee fighter who attacks you gets drenched
- You attack them all with advantage
- They all count for your quest kills
- You are a walking death zone

**The aura is invisible until enemies enter - then spray erupts, mist clings to them, and seawater drips from their armor. They're in the ocean's killing ground now, and Moan-a's champion has the advantage.**

## Tactical Considerations

**Positioning:**
- Stand in doorways or chokepoints → force enemies through your wet aura
- Move toward clustered enemies → soak multiple targets at once
- Chase fleeing enemies → they're already wet, advantage on all attacks

**Counterplay:**
- Enemies can stay 15+ feet away with ranged attacks (but Undertow solves this)
- Enemies with high mobility can hit-and-run (but wet lasts 1 minute)
- Area denial abilities can keep you at distance (but you're a paladin - high AC, high HP)

**Strengths:**
- Automatic wet application in melee
- Permanent advantage against wet targets
- No resource cost, always active
- Scales with number of nearby enemies
- Massive synergy with all other abilities

## Compliance Notes

**Passive Ability - Not Part of Tier System**: Ocean's Domain is a starting passive feature that Yyroizgt begins with. It does not count toward the tier purchase system and is not sold in the shop.

**Design Intent**: This passive makes Yyroizgt a walking ocean domain, automatically applying wet status to nearby enemies and gaining advantage against them. It emphasizes his role as Moan-a's chosen champion who carries her killing seas wherever he walks.
