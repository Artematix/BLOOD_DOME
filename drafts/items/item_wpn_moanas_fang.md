# Moan-a's Fang

*Three wicked prongs of bronze and blessed steel. The weapon thirsts. The shark hungers. The ocean remembers.*

## Description

This trident is not merely a weapon - it is a **living relic**. Forged from bronze blessed by Moan-a herself, its three barbed prongs are said to be the teeth of a shark demigod who died defending the goddess's temple. The spirit of that divine predator was bound into the weapon, granting it terrible sentience and hunger.

The weapon is warm to the touch, pulsing faintly like a heartbeat. When submerged in water, spectral shark fins shimmer around it. When thrust through flesh, victims swear they feel jaws clamping down rather than prongs piercing. The trident **wants** to kill. It pulls toward wounded prey. It thirsts for blood in the water.

**Physical Traits:**
- **Weight**: 4 lbs
- **Length**: 6 feet
- **Material**: Bronze shaft with three steel prongs
- **Markings**: Wave patterns etched along the shaft, shark tooth symbols at the base of each prong
- **Aura**: Faint smell of brine and blood, always slightly damp

## Effect

**Shark Spirit (Passive):**
When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can choose to mark them with the ocean's touch. The target gains the "wet" status for 1 minute as seawater manifests around the wound. You can do this once per turn at no action cost - the shark spirit simply recognizes prey.

**Predator's Hunger (Passive):**
When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with this weapon, the shark spirit feeds on their dying breath. You gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) as the weapon transfers a portion of their life force to you.

**Versatile Weapon:**
- One-handed: 1d6 piercing damage
- Two-handed: 1d8 piercing damage
- Thrown: Range 20/60 feet, returns to your hand if you speak the command word "Fang" in Aquan

## Lore

### The Shark Demigod's Sacrifice

Long ago, when Moan-a's temple was besieged by enemies of the sea, a shark demigod named **Vorash the Unending** defended her altar to his last breath. He fought with jaws and fury, tearing through hundreds before finally falling. The goddess, moved by his devotion, would not let him fade.

She bound his spirit into a trident forged from his own teeth, transformed into bronze and steel through divine ritual. The weapon would serve her faithful forever - a living predator in the hands of her priests, forever hunting, forever hungry.

### The Weapon's Nature

Moan-a's Fang is **semi-sentient**. It cannot speak, but its wielder feels its urges:
- **Hunger** when near wounded enemies (it pulls toward them)
- **Satisfaction** when it tastes blood
- **Frustration** when idle too long
- **Recognition** when near water or wet targets

The weapon is most content when killing in water, feeding on corpses in the Ritual of Moan-a, or hunting wounded prey. It has no loyalty except to its purpose: serve Moan-a through slaughter.

### Why It's Affordable

At only 5 gold, this weapon is accessible early in the Blood Dome. The price reflects several factors:
- It's a **trident** (not the most popular martial weapon)
- It has no magical attack/damage bonuses
- It requires **attunement** (limits flexibility)
- It's **character-exclusive** (can't be sold to other players for profit)
- The shark spirit makes it **unsettling** to non-believers

But for Yyroizgt, a devoted priest of Moan-a, this weapon is priceless. The wet status application alone makes it essential for his playstyle, and the temporary HP gain rewards his aggressive combat approach.

## Strategic Value

**For Yyroizgt's Playstyle:**
1. **Wet Application**: Free wet status once per turn on hit - enables all his wet-synergy abilities
2. **Quest Progress**: Every hit can mark someone for the Blood Tide quest (damage wet targets)
3. **Sustain**: Temporary HP on kills provides survivability in extended fights
4. **Synergy**: Works perfectly with Ocean's Domain, Tidal Strike, Crushing Depths
5. **Thematic**: The weapon IS the shark from his rest ability's flavor text

**In the Blood Dome:**
- **Early Purchase**: At 5g, affordable in the first or second shop visit
- **Scales**: Remains useful throughout the game due to wet application
- **Versatile**: Can throw it at range or wield two-handed for 1d8 damage
- **Ritual Component**: This is the weapon used in Ritual of Moan-a to impale corpses

## Compliance Notes

**Pricing**: 5 gold buy price fits the user's request. Sell price is 2 gold (40% instead of typical 50%) because it's a sacred weapon that's hard to sell and character-exclusive.

**Character-Exclusive**: Only Yyroizgt can use this weapon, as it requires attunement and is bound to Moan-a's faithful.

**Balanced**: No +1/+2/+3 bonuses keep it from being overpowered, but the wet application and temp HP make it valuable for the specific character.
